   Controlled by the 'list.all.projects' and 'list.all.tags' configuration
   variables (thanks to Dirk Deimeke).

   "description.word:th" will not.  For partial word matches, there is still
   "description.contains:th".
 + Added new 'config' command to display the configuration settings of task.
   As a consequence 'version' now only shows the version number and legal

   display 'High' rather than the abbreviated 'H'.
 + Task now supports .taskrc command line overrides using rc.name:value and
   the new rc.name=value to accommodate a frequent mistake.
 + The color rules for projects (color.project.foo) now matches on partial
   project names, the same way as filters.
 + The color command now takes a color as an argument, and displays that color
   with sample text.
 + Added 2 new configuration variables to display the details of tasks with due
   dates when doing a 'task cal' for the corresponding months:
   'calendar.details' and 'calendar.details.report'

   tasks, days with overdue tasks, weekend days and week numbers in the
   calendar:
   'calendar.color.today', 'color.calendar.due', 'calendar.calendar.overdue',
   'color.calendar.weekend'and 'color.calendar.weeknumber'.

   and the corresponding holiday.X.name and holiday.X.date variables.
   The default dateformat being YMD (20101224) set by dateformat.holiday.

   active.indicator configuration variable to something other than the default
   of *.
 + Task can now use an alternate recurrence indicator by setting the
   recurrence.indicator configuration variable to something other than the
   default of R.
 + Added a new file, README.build, which provides assistance troubleshooting
   build-related problems on different operating systems and environments.
 + Fixed bug #316 which caused the timesheet report to display an oddly sorted
   list.
 + Fixed bug #317 which colored tasks in the 'completed' report according to
   due dates, which are no longer relevant to a completed task (thanks to
   Cory Donnelly).
 + Fixed bug #347 which used only a lowercase "all" to confirm multiple changes
   instead of an uppercase "All" like the "Yes" answer.
 + Fixed bug that was causing the 'completed' report to sort incorrectly.
 + Fixed bug that showed a calendar for the year 2037 when 'task calendar due'
   was run, and there are no tasks with due dates.
 + Fixed bug #360 which prevented certain modifications to recurring tasks
   (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #299 which prevented excluding multiple projects from a report,
   by using "task list project.isnt:foo project.isnt:bar" (thanks to John
   Florian).
 + Fixed bug #368 which caused recurring tasks 'until' dates to be rendered as
   epoch numbers instead of dates (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
 + Fixed bug #369 which prevented the config command from setting quoted or
   unquoted multi-word values (thanks to Richard Querin).

   mis-identifying the task as recurring just because it had a due date
   (thanks to John Florian).

   color.alternate, which was (a) not applied first, and (b) not blended
   with the other color rules (thanks to Richard Querin).

   256-color space.

   not mentioned anywhere (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Fixed bug #319 that caused task to not properly detect the removal of a
   tag when obtaining confirmation from the user fora bulk modification
   (thanks to Cory Donnelly).

1.8.0 (7/21/2009) 14977ef317bd004dae2f2c313e806af9f2a2140c
 + Added zsh tab completion script (thanks to P.C. Shyamshankar).
 + Fixed bug that cause the _forcecolor configuration variable to be
   considered obsolete (thank to Bruce Dillahunty).
 + Fixed documentation errors (thanks to Thomas@BIC).
 + The 'weekstart' configuration variable now controls the 'calendar'
   report (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + The 'displayweeknumber' configuration variable now controls the display
   of week number in the 'calendar' report (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Supports '--' argument to indicate that all subsequence arguments are
   part of the description, despite what they otherwise might mean.
 + Removed support for the obsolete task file format 1 (never released).
 + Fixed bug that allowed blank annotations to be added (thanks to Bruce
   Dillahunty).
 + Supports negative tag filters, so that (task list +foo -bar) now filters
   tasks that have the "foo" tag, but do not have the "bar" tag (thanks to
   Chris Pride).
 + Custom reports now support a more compact form of the "age" column,
   called "age_compact" (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Supports 'rc.name:value' for a command line override to .taskrc data
   (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Removed obsolete DEVELOPERS file.  The online support forums at
   http://taskwarrior.org will provide better information.
 + Fixed bug that kept some deleted tasks showing up on the calendar report
   (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Now asks the user to confirm large changes if configuration variable
   'confirmation' is set to 'yes'.  A large change is one that completely
   replaces a task description, or operates on a large number of tasks,
   which defaults to 4 but is configurable via the 'bulk' configuration
   variable  (thanks to John Florian).
 + Now echoes back the new task ID on 'add' (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty).
 + The new "shell" command provides an interactive shell for task.  All
   commands are supported (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty, Federico Hernandez,
   and John Florian).
 + New "recurring" report to list all recurring tasks.
 + New, more flexible, more consistent, grep-able file format.
 + If task is renamed to "cal", or there is a symlink to task called "cal",
   then task can act as a replacement for the Unix "cal" command.
 + Supports arguments to the cal command like "month year", "year", etc.
 + The "tags" report now shows the tag usage count.
 + The "projects" report now shows totals by project and priority.
 + Now supports attribute modifiers that allow much finer control over report
   filtering, for example "task list due.before:friday", or "task list
   pri.not:H" and many more.
 + Now supports new "age_compact" and "wait" custom report columns.
 + Now supports colorization of the header and footnote messages that are
   printed before and after report output, with the 'color.header' and
   'color.footnote' configuration variables.
 + Now supports the 'limit' attribute, to control the number of tasks that
   are shown, for example: "task list limit:10".
 + Now supports a debug mode that can be used to generate helpful information
   when reporting a problem.  Just run the command with "task rc.debug:on ..."
   and diagnostics will be generated that will help pinpoint a problem.
 + The new "undo" command replaces the old "undo" and "undelete" command
   with a complete undo stack that can rollback all changes.
 + While waiting for a file lock, task states the reason for the delay.
 + Now supports a 'waiting' state that causes tasks to not appear until
   a certain date, for example "task <ID> wait:<date>".  The task
   will then not show up on any report (except 'all') until that date.
 + The "active", "completed", "overdue" and "next" reports are now custom
   reports, and therefore modifiable.
 + Now supports a 'waiting' custom report to list all waiting tasks.
 + Now supports a 'recurring' custom report to list all recurring tasks.
 + Now supports an 'all' report to list all tasks, including deleted
 + Supports command aliases - create an alias for any command by creating
   a .taskrc entry like "alias.new_name=old_name".
   and completed tasks.
 + Now over 1,600 unit tests, helping to maintain code quality.

   or completed.data file (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Added details to the "info" report about recurring tasks (thanks to T.
   Charles Yun).
 + Now writes a sample "defaultwidth" configuration variable to the default
   .taskrc file (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Task allows commands that require an ID to now be given a sequence, which
   is a set of IDs.  This allows commands like "task delete 1 2 5-10,12".
 + Fixed bug in the ghistory report, which caused it to only show a new
   month if a task was added during that month.
 + New command "duplicate" which allow existing task(s) to be duplicated,
   and also have modifications applied (thanks to David J Patrick).

   to the task(s) (thanks to David J Patrick).
 + Improved word wrapping in various output.
 + Fixed bug that added an extra line between header and graph in the
   ghistory report.
 + Added simple 'taskprogram' mailing list subscribe form to the web site.
 + For custom reports that define a "limit" to the number of rows of output
   such as "oldest" and "newest", task allows an override value.  For
   example "task oldest 5" will display the 5 oldest tasks.
 + Modified the "stats" report so that it has the same aesthetics as the
   other reports.
 + New "timesheet" command displays tasks completed and started, per week,

 + The task and taskrc man pages are here.  Try "man task", "man taskrc"
   (thanks to Federico Hernandez and P.C. Shyamshankar).
 + Fixed bug that causes task to create a default .task directory, even if
   data.location specified otherwise (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + New "edit" command that fires up a text editor (uses 'editor' configuration
   variable, $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variable) and allows direct
   editing of all editable task details.

1.6.1 (4/24/2009) 1b6faf57c998617024d0348a87b941a5d2ab2249

    five times a week, and not on weekends (thanks to Chris Pride).
  + UTF8 text is now supported in task project names, tags and descriptions.
  + Fixed bug that caused the y/n confirmation on task deletion to ignore the
    Enter key and fail to re-prompt (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty).
  + When the "echo.command" configuration variable is set to "yes", it causes
    commands that modify tasks to display which task was affected (thanks to
    Bruce Dillahunty).
  + A task can now be annotated with the command "task <id> annotate ...", and
    a timestamped annotation will appear in reports.
  + A 'description_only' column is now available for use in custom reports,
    and it excludes annotations.
  + A task can now be upgraded to a recurring task by adding a recurrence
    frequency, a due date, and an optional until date.
  + When a recurring task is modified, all other instances of the recurring
    task are also modified.
  + Custom reports now support user-specified column labels (thanks to T.
    Charles Yun).
  + Task can now import tasks from a variety of data formats, including task
    export files from versions 1.4.3 and earlier, versions 1.5.0 and later,
    todo.sh 2.x, CSV, plain text and task command line.  See online docs for
    full details.
  + Export was including 'id' in the column header even though it was not
    included in the data.
  + The task file format has changed slightly.  Please back up your task
    data files before upgrading to 1.6.0.
  + Added new column 'recurrence_indicator' that displays an 'R' if the task
    is a recurring task.  This column can be added to any custom report.
  + Added new column 'tag_indicator' that displays a '+' if the task
    has any tags.  This column can be added to any custom report.
  + Fixed bug where sometimes a task description was concatenated oddly if
    there was a colon somewhere in the description.
  + Fixed bug that caused recurring annual tasks to exhibit a creeping due
    date, because of an assumption of 365 days per year, which failed to
    consider leap years (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
  + Annotations can now be modified with the substitution commands /from/to/.
  + Substitutions can now be made global with /from/to/g and all occurrences
    of "from" will be replaced with "to".

    to allow debugging.
  + Allow lower case priorities, and automatically upper case them.
  + Added support for "due" configuration variable which defines the number
    of days in the future when a task is considered due.
  + Added support for custom reports, comprised of a set of column names and
    sort order, with optional filtering in the configuration file.  This
    means user-defined reports can be written, and the reports currently
    in the configuration file can be renamed.  Several of task's built in
    reports have been converted to user-defined reports.
  + New online documentation for custom reports.
  + New algorithm for determining when the "nag" message is displayed.
  + Fixed bug where task hangs with a certain combination of recurring tasks
    and shadow files.

  + Task now has a large (and growing) test suite and bug regression tests
    to help ensure higher quality releases.
  + Fixed bug that caused performance hit during table rendering.

    recently completed tasks.

1.4.3 (11/1/2008) 8639e9260646c8c9224e0fc47e5d2443b46eecfc
  + Fixed misleading task count at bottom on "info" report.
  + Added support for a shadow file that contains a plain text task report,
    with the "shadow.file" and "shadow.command" configuration variables.

    changes.  Useful for integrating with "Samurize".
  + Task now displays a message whenever a shadow file is updated, if the
    "shadow.notify" configuration variable is set "on".
  + Bug: adding a task with a \n, \r or \f in it now fails properly.
  + Removed "usage" command, and support for "command.logging" configuration
    variable.
  + Added documentation for Shadow files.
  + Added documentation for task filters.

  + "task undo" can now retract a "task done" command, provided no reports
    have been run (and therefore TDB::gc run).
  + Task now correctly sorts on entire strings, instead of just the first
    character (thanks to Andy Lester).
  + Task now uses dashes (-----) to column underlines when color is disabled
    (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau).
  + Task now allows mixed case attribute names (pri:, PRI:, Pri: ...) and
    commands (add, ADD, Add ...) (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau).
  + Task now supports a default project and priority for new tasks, via
    the new "default.project" and "default.priority" configuration variables
    (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau).
  + Task supports improved word-wrapping to the terminal width.
  + Task now supports "default.command" configuration variable (for example
    it could contain "list due:tomorrow") that is the command that is run
    whenever task is invoked with no arguments.
  + Task supports modifying the existing description of a task, with the
    following syntax: task <id> "new description ...".
  + Bug: Now properly supports relative dates in filters (task list due:eom,
    task list due:tomorrow, task list due:23rd ...).
  + Bug: Source now properly includes <string.h> in order to build clean
    using gcc 4.3 (thanks to H. İbrahim Güngör).

  + New configuration variable, "defaultwidth" that determines the width
    of tables when ncurses support is not available.
  + Bug: "showage" configuration variable should apply to all reports, not
    just the ones based on "list".
